# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

We try to implement a Deep Neural Network with one hidden layer to be trained on the ![fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.

We don't use **any** framework, rather only **numpy** to implement the *Neural Network From Scratch*.

Although, we do use tensorflow to import the fashion-mnist dataset.
